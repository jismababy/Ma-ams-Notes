MVC Life cycle:

1.  Request for a View is sent by the browser and the URL pattern
would be 
http:\\localhost:56770\Controllername\actionmethodname

2. URL is scanned for the controller name and actionmethod name 
by the MVCRouteHandler and the controller name is passed to
the Controller Factory

3. The controller factory creates an instance of the controller 
and passes the object to invoke the action method.

4. The Actionmethod checks for the ActionFilter and after executing
the action filters the result is passed to the ViewEngine.

5. The ViewEngine scans the View and shares the response to the 
browser.
